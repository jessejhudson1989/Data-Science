# Data-Science

This respository contains machine learning projects covering data science, time series forecasting, sales forecasting, stock price prediction, computer vision and movie ratings. The machine learning alogrithms used were LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture widely used in deep learning, Prophet, a procedure for forecasting time series data, ARIMA, an autoregressive integrated moving average model that is a statistical model that uses historical data to predict future values, classification of images using a CNN and calculating mean, mode and median of movie ratings.
